## My Family Circle

This project stems from a current family issue. I live no where near anyone in my family. Social media websites like Facebook and Instagram are great sites and platforms that have helped keep me connected with them, but they are often filled with other unnecessary information. This app aims to connect families together and as these families create more families.

## Project Structure

The project is seperated into `server/` and `client/` code bases within the `src/` folder.

Within `server/`, you will find a few folders for database connection and utils (`db/`), controllers for business logic (`controllers/`), functions for express middlewars (`middlewares/`), server routes (`routes/`), and configuration (`config/`).

Within `client/` codebase, you will find the `App.jsx` to start, along with other folders for frontend organization.
